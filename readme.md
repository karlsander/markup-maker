# Markup Maker

An extremely bare Wordpress theme that returns the markup fragment for single post pages with all scripts and styles inlined.

The intended use is with Wordpress as a headless CMS. I couldn't figure out a way to get rich Gutenberg posts through the API and this works. Post listings, metadata and URLs can be fetched via the Wordpress REST API.
